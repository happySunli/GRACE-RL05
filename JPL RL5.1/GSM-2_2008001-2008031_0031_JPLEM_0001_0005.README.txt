This is a January 2008 field. The 90x90 spherical harmonics are determined
using 31 days of 5-minute GPS-GRACE data and 5-second KBR range rate data. The
solved for local parameters include satellite initial states, daily biases
(XYZ component in SRF) for GRACE accelerometer, empirical biases/drifts/once per rev.
biases every 1.5-hour for KBR range-rate data. The global parameters are monthly
scale factors (XZ component in SRF)for ACC data,  spherical harmonics from
GPS and KBR range rate data.

Convolution formalism with 90x90 of convolution weights derived from GOT4.7
and self consistant equilibrium model are used for ocean tide modeling.
100x100 of harmonics from atmosphere/ocean dealiasing (AOD) products
(release 5) are also used in GRACE data processing to account for the short
term mass variations in the atmosphere. 180x180 of GIF48 model is the nominal
geopotential model. 100x100 harmonics expansion of Ray/Ponte (2003) S1/S2 model
is used to account for the air tide. ITRF and ICRF coordinate transformation 
is consistent with the IERS2010 recommendations.

GPS antenna calibration and IGS phase center used in GPS data processing.
GPS transmitter clocks are fixed to FLINN solution, while GRACE receiver 
clock are fixed to Level-1 solutions.
