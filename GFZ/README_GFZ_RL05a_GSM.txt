GFZ processes new RL05a version for GSM 

GFZ has generated and delivered a reprocessed RL05 time series called RL05a for January 2003 till July 2013. All RL05a Level-2 products are available at ISDC and PO.DAAC. When making your request at the ISDC retrieval pages, the RL05a GSM products can be found under the same revision number (“5”) as the RL05 GSM products and are distinguishable by the string “_005a” (instead of “_0005”) at the end of the product name. At the PO.DAAC archive, the RL05a GSM products can be found in the directory “allData/grace/L2/GFZ/RL05”. Note that GAx products are not affected and need not be replaced! Further details are described in the “Release notes for GFZ RL05 GRACE L2 products”, also available at both archives. For the missing months in 2002 (soon to be delivered) and all upcoming months starting with October 2013, only RL05a products will be generated, i.e. the GFZ RL05 time-series will not be continued.
